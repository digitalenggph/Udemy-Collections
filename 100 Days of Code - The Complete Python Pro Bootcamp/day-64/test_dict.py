Rider\"; the Monterey Pop film outtake \"Pictures of Lily\"; live and interview footage from Helsinki, Finland, in May 1967; and promotional films for Tommy, linked by a few interview segments in which Pete Townshend explains the songs. There's even the U.S. promo film for \"Substitute,\" in which they mimed the amended lyrics (omitting the reference to a black father) in the American 45 version..",

Before this release, several other bootleg DVDs had compiled the 1960s Who footage, with varying degrees of success. It's difficult, however, to imagine a better, more comprehensive one than this two-DVD collection, which assembles almost four hours of live, mimed, promo, interview, and documentary clips from various sources. The image and sound quality are usually as good as, or better than, what's seen or heard on those previous compilations.",
